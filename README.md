# Gene_Identification

Hidden Markov Model for Gene Identification
Overview
This project uses a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to identify coding and non-coding regions in genomic sequences based on genotype data, position, and GC content. The model predicts hidden states corresponding to these regions, providing insights into gene structure.

Features
HMM-Based Analysis: Predicts hidden genomic states using the hmmlearn library.
Genomic Feature Engineering: Includes position, genotype, and one-hot encoded chromosomes as model inputs.
Streamlit Visualizations: Interactive visualizations to display coding and non-coding regions.
Data Processing: Efficient handling and cleaning of large genomic datasets.

Technologies Used
Python, hmmlearn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Streamlit for interactive visualizations.

Usage
Clone the repo and install dependencies:
bash
git clone https://github.com/Sngrviv/hmm-gene-identification.git
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Streamlit app:
bash
streamlit run app.py
Example Output
The Streamlit app visualizes predicted states across genomic positions, distinguishing coding from non-coding regions.
